* How I got this to run
  I've had to nuke the shebang lines for jcpp script and the analyze script. The
  bash test in analyzeBusyBox.sh expects all the *.dbg files to be absent. So
  the correct way to run is:
  #+begin_src
  ./prepareBusybox.sh && ./analyzeBusybox.sh
  #+end_src

  Then I had to change this line:
  #+begin_src
  # partialPreprocFlags="-c $system.properties $partialPreprocFlags"
  #+end_src

  in the main run script ~jcpp.conf~ to point to ~redhat.properties~ instead of
  system.properties which defaulted to ~ubuntu~
